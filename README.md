Contains paradigms for Slovak

## Data

Description: the file contains automatic conversion of MorfFlex-SK inflectional dictionary to the UniMorph scheme. Proper names as well as some archaic and non-standard forms from the original data were omitted.

Source: [LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ](https://lindat.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-3277)

Convertion to UniMorph: Witold Kiera≈õ

Known issues: forms of reflexive verbs lack reflexive markers as they could not be reconstructed from the original data. It is possible to restore them in future based on some other resources such as valence dictionaries or treebanks.
